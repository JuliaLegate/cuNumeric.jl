#= Purpose of test: daxpy
    -- Focused on double 2 dimenional. Does not test other types or dims. 
    -- NDArray intialization 
    -- NDArray writing and reading scalar indexing
    --          shows both [i, j] and [(i, j)] working
    -- NDArray addition and multiplication
=#
function daxpy_basic()
    N = 100
    α = 56.6
    dims = (N, N)

    # Base julia arrays
    x_cpu = rand(Float64, dims);
    y_cpu = rand(Float64, dims);

    # cunumeric arrays
    x = cuNumeric.zeros(dims)
    y = cuNumeric.zeros(dims)

    # Initialize NDArrays with random values
    for i in 1:N
        for j in 1:N
            # set cunumeric.jl arrays
            x[i, j] = x_cpu[i, j]
            y[i, j] = y_cpu[i, j]
        end
    end

    result = α * x + y
    result_cpu = α .* x_cpu .+ y_cpu
    @test result == result_cpu
    @test result_cpu == result
