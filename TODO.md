## TO-DO List of Missing Important Features
- Implement `unary_reduction` over arbitrary dims
- Out-parameter `binary_op`
- Replace `as_type` with `Base.convert`
- Integer powers (e.g x^3)
- Support Ints on methods that takes floats
- Programatic manipulation of Legate hardware config (not currently possible)
- Float32 random number generation (not possible in current C++ API)
- Normal random numbers (not possible in current C++ API)
- Add Aqua.jl to CI to ensure we didn't pirate any types
- Fix CodeCov reports
